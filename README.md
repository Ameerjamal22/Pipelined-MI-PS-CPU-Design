# Pipelined-MI-PS-CPU-Design
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a 16-bit pipelined MIPS CPU, designed to execute a comprehensive set of arithmetic, logical, memory access, and control flow operations. The CPU features a 5-stage pipeline, separate data and instruction memories, and effective hazard handling mechanisms.
